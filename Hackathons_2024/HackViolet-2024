# HackViolet 2024
 - February 3-4, 2024
 - Association for Women in Computing at Virginia Tech University 
 - Blacksburg, Virginia, United States

## Event Summary

Our hackathon is unique because it is a female-empowerment hackathon and through our event we strive to empower underrepresented minorities in the technology field. A few of our most interesting workshops and events were mentor speed dating, LeetCode competition, and technical interview workshops. GitHub was featured at our event as a required part of all project submissions and we encouraged hackers to practice using Git. To prepare our hackers, we held an Command Line and Git, and a GitHub CoPilot workshop. We utilized Git to teach and encourage our hackers to practice version control and learn collaborative coding practices.

## Impact of GitHub Grant
We used the GitHub Grant funds to fund some of our workshops and activties that took place during HackViolet. We also used funds to support our mentorship program this year. This year we saw a large increase in mentorship interest. We provided refreshments and supplies to our mentors and mentees so that they could have a more enjoyable mentorship experience. These funds helped us support our hackers who were looking for mentors during the weekend. We used the funding to support our mentors during their shifts which in turn allowed them to better help our hackers. Additionally, we used a portion of funding to provide extra/emergency refreshments, such as snacks and drinks, throughout the weekend to our hackers and mentors.
